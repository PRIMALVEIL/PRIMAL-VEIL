  <h1>Privacy Policy for PRIMAL VEIL</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 27/09/2025</p>

  <h2>The information we collect</h2>
  <p>PRIMAL VEIL may temporarily process <strong>voice data</strong> during gameplay for features such as
  multiplayer communication. We do <strong>not</strong> automatically record or download your audio. 
  Recordings may only be created by players themselves if they choose to report inappropriate behavior 
  (e.g., harassment or offensive language) through our community Discord server.</p>

  <h2>How we use the information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To enable in-game voice chat between players to allow communication.</li>
    <li>To allow players to record and submit reports of misconduct at their own discretion.</li>
    <li>To review reports for community safety and enforcement. Misconduct is not tolerated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data storage</h2>
  <p>Audio recordings are <strong>not</strong> collected or stored by PRIMAL VEIL directly. If a player 
  submits a report, the recording is shared through our Discord community server. In that case, the 
  storage and processing of the recording is handled according to <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a>. 
  We do not share recordings with third parties outside of moderation needs.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>PRIMAL VEIL is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
